    <h2>Redirect Authentication Type Design</h2>
    by <a href="http://grumet.net/weblog/">Andrew Grumet</a> on 22 September, 2003.
    <hr />

    <p>
      This document proposes a design for handling external authentication from a 
      remote system such as SloanSpace.
    </p>
    <h3>The Big Picture</h3>
    <p>
      The redirect authentication system is part of our efforts to hook into existing 
      infrastructure. Chances are good that new adopters already have a sign in 
      system. We want to take advantage of that when possible. This system proposes a 
      design for handling the case where central passwords are entereed into a 
      central web application to which we will redirect the user for login.
    </p>

    <h3>OpenACS</h3>
    <p>
      After signing into OpenACs, users wishing to log in to another site will 
      either browse to or be redirected to <code>/auth-server/login</code>. This 
      script will generate and store a random string to be used by the the client 
      system. It will also generate a nonrepeating integer to combine with the random 
      string to create a login token. The integer, random string and OpenACS <code>user_id</code>
      will be stored in the database for later use.
    </p>
    <pre><p class="code">create sequence auth_server_token_id_seq start with 1;

create table authentication_server_token (
    token_id                    integer
                                constraint auth_srv_token_pk
                                primary key,
    user_id                     integer
                                constraint auth_srv_user_id_nn
                                not null
                                constraint auth_srv_user_id_fk
                                references users,
    token                       char(40)
                                constraint auth_srv_token_nn
                                not null,
    consumed_on                 date
);</p></pre>

    <h3>Other System</h3>
    <p>
      After database insertion, the user will be redirected to a
      particular URL on the other site with the unique key added as a
      URL argument. The client login page will make a request back to
      SloanSpace, sending the unique key.  Sloanspace will try to
      match this key against a row in the database having a non-null
      <code>consumed_on</code> column. If a match is found, OpenACS
      with return a document with the logged in user's email address
      and perhaps their first and last names. It will also mark the
      token as having been consumed.
